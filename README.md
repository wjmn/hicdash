# hicdash: Generate a Hi-C Structural Variant Dashboard

This project provides a command to generate a self-contained HTML file containing plots of all identified structural variants from a Hi-C contact matrix for easy and fast review. 

This is currently a work in-progress. This project is designed to work with the outputs from the [Arima-SV Pipeline (v1.3)](https://github.com/ArimaGenomics/Arima-SV-Pipeline).

Dashboard sections:
1. Quality-control metrics
2. Full Hi-C contact matrix
3. Zoomed plots of all structural variants (4-box view and close-up view).
