class VariantCategory(Enum):

    Simple structural variants can be categorised as either:

    - Deletion
    - Duplication
    - Inversion, or other intra-chromosomal event.
    - Translocation

    Deletions, duplications and inversions are intra-chromosomal events, while
    translocations are inter-chromosomal events.

    The determination of the category of a structural variant is based on the
    strandness of each breakpoint. See:

    Song F, Xu J, Dixon J, Yue F. Analysis of Hi-C Data for Discovery of Structural Variations in Cancer. Methods Mol Biol. 2022;2301:143-161.

    For the purposes of this dashboard generator, structural variants are
    categorised in isolation. The following rules are therefore used:

    1. All inter-chromosomal breakpoints are categorised as translocations.
    2. An intra-chromosomal breakpoint with +/- strandness is a deletion.
    3. An intra-chromosomal breakpoint with -/+ strandness is a duplication.
    4. Any other intra-chromosomal breakpoints are categorised as inversions
       or other.

    This isn't always perfect, so take these categories with a grain of salt. 

    Determining proper inversions requires two structural variant calls from
    the default outputs of hic_breakfinder, so for simplicity to categorise
    all structural variant calls in isolation, they are simply grouped
    here as inversions *or other*.
